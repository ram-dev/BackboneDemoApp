## Backbone Demo App
### Experiments in JSPM Packaging 

#### Need dependency

1. NPM and nodejs
2. JSPM install - `npm install jspm -g`
3. Install serve - `npm install serve -g`

#### Setup

1. Install [Serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve)
2. Clone this repo
3. In the checkout folder run the command `npm install`
4. In the checkout folder run the command `jspm install`

#### Run 

You should now have all the pre-requisites installed, so it's worth testing the non bundled version first:

1. Open a new terminal and go to the checkout folder
2. In the checkout folder run `serve`
3. Open Chrome and enter `http://localhost:3000`
4. Open the Dev Tools and choose the Network Tab


Good luck!
